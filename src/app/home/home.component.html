		 ngForm:
		 When we have a form in Angular template, Angular is going to create a directive for this form.
		 This directive is called ngForm. As soon as you import the FormsModule, this directive becomes 
		 active by default on all <form> tags. ngForm creates a top-level FormGroup instance and binds it to a 
		 form to track aggregate form value and validation status.

		 You can export the directive into a local template variable using ngForm as the key (ex: #myForm="ngForm"). 
		 This is optional, but useful. Many properties from the underlying FormGroup instance are duplicated on 
		 the directive itself, so a reference to it will give you access to the aggregate value and validity 
		 status of the form, as well as user interaction properties like dirty and touched.

		 You can listen to the directive's ngSubmit event to be notified when the user has triggered a form submission. 
		 The ngSubmit event will be emitted with the original form submission event.

		 ngModel:
		 NgModel directive creates a FormControl instance from a domain model created in class and binds it 
		 to a form control element. FormControl keeps track of user interaction and validation status of the 
		 form control. NgModel can be used standalone as well as with the parent form.

		 If used within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child control.

		 To use FormControl, all you need is the ngModel selector to activate it.

		 NgModel accepts a domain model as an optional Input. If you have a one-way binding to ngModel with [] syntax, changing 
		 the value of the domain model in the component class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding 
		 with [()] syntax, the value in the UI will always be synced back to the domain model in your class as well.
		 If we use neither one-way binding not two-way binding still we need to use ngModel attribute in fields when using with 
		 parent form as following: <input name="message" ngModel> 
		 Otherwise this field will not be registered with parent form and its value will not be passed to our class on form submit. 

		 If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated FormControl (like validity state), you can also export the 
		 directive into a local template variable using ngModel as the key (ex: #myVar="ngModel"). You can then access the 
		 control using the directive's control property, but most properties you'll need (like valid and dirty) will fall 
		 through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly.
		 
		 novalidate turns off the auto validation of the form.
